      <h2 class="mt-10">What Are Blockchain Bridges and How Do They Work?</h2>
      <p>
        A blockchain bridge is a tool that lets you port assets from one blockchain to
        another, solving one of the main pain points within blockchains   a lack of
        interoperability.<br />
        Since blockchain assets are often not compatible with one another, bridges create
        synthetic derivatives that represent an asset from another blockchain.<br />
        If you use a bridge to send one Solana coin to an Ethereum wallet, that wallet
        will receive a token that has been “wrapped” by the bridge converted to a token
        based on the target
        blockchain. In this case, the Ethereum wallet would receive a "bridge" version of
        Solana that has been converted to an ERC-20 token the generic token standard for
        fungible tokens on
        the Ethereum blockchain. <br />
        While bridges open up new markets and work toward a brighter multi-chain future,
        they come with their own security challenges, as proven by a huge $326 million
        exploit on the nascent
        Wormhole bridge in February 2022.<br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-10">Types of blockchain bridges</h2>
      <p>
        Some bridges, known as unidirectional or one-way bridges, allow you to port assets
        only to the target blockchain and not the other way around. For instance, Wrapped
        Bitcoin allows you
        to send bitcoin to the Ethereum blockchain to convert BTC to an ERC-20 stablecoin
        but it doesn't let you send ether to the Bitcoin blockchain.<br />
        Other bridges like Wormhole and Multichain are bidirectional, or two-way, meaning
        you can freely convert assets to and from blockchains. Just as you can send Solana
        to Ethereum's
        blockchain, you can send ether to Solana.<br />
        Bridges are either custodial (also known as centralized or trusted) or
        noncustodial (decentralized or trustless). The difference explains who controls
        the tokens that are used to create the
        bridged assets. All wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) is held in custody by BitGo, making it
        a centralized bridge. Conversely, bridged assets on Wormhole are held by the
        protocol, meaning it is
        more decentralized.
        While hardline advocates of decentralization might venture that the custodial
        nature of WBTC makes it less secure than decentralized alternatives, bridges that
        decentralize custody over
        bridged assets aren't necessarily safer, as shown by the Wormhole bridge
        exploit.<br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-10">Why use a blockchain bridge?</h2>
      <p>
        Porting assets from one blockchain to another blockchain comes with a myriad of
        benefits. First, the blockchain onto which you port assets might be cheaper and
        faster than its native
        blockchain. This is certainly true for Ethereum, where high transaction fees and
        slow throughput make it difficult for newcomers to get involved in decentralized
        finance (DeFi).<br />
        If investors ported assets to a layer 2 network a faster blockchain that sits atop
        the Ethereum blockchain, like Arbitrum or Polygon they could trade ERC-20 tokens
        for a fraction of the
        cost without sacrificing exposure to Ethereum tokens.<br />
        Other investors might use bridges to make the most of markets that exist only on
        another blockchain. For instance, the DeFi protocol Orca is available only on
        Solana, but supports a
        wrapped version of ETH.<br />
        Bridges are becoming easier to use. Many DeFi protocols have integrated bridges to
        let their users swap tokens from different protocols without having to leave the
        platform. This makes
        the process of converting tokens through bridges less cumbersome.<br />

      <h2 class="mt-10">What are the biggest blockchain bridges?</h2>
      <p>
        According to DeFi Llama, there was $21.8 billion worth of crypto locked in bridges
        as of March 2022. The largest blockchain bridge is Wrapped Bitcoin, accounting for
        almost half of the
        bridge market, with $10.2 billion in total value locked (TVL). DeFi Llama pegs
        Multichain as the largest cross-chain bridge, with about $7 billion in TVL.<br />
        A dashboard on Dune Analytics shows that the Avalanche Bridge is the largest
        Ethereum bridge, with about $6 billion in TVL, followed by Polygon ($5 billion
        TVL) and the Fantom
        Anyswap Bridge ($4.2 billion TVL).<br />
