        If you've been in the crypto space for a little while now, you may have heard the term “staking.” You might
        still have some questions around what it means, how it works, the risks
        associated with staking, and which cryptocurrencies offer stalking rewards. Not to worry, in this blog post,
        we'll go over the basics of staking for you.<br />
        But first, we'll start by saying that crypto staking is the process of putting a set amount of cryptocurrency
        you already own as collateral to support the verification of blockchain
        transactions. Participants that offer up their crypto are rewarded for doing so.<br />
        Another way to think about it is that participants are incentivized to earn rewards by maintaining the integrity
        of the blockchain without a centralized party. While staking is a great way
        to build your cryptocurrency portfolio, it does come with some risks.<br />
        Read on to learn more about how staking works, the risks involved, and how to get started.<br />

      <h2 class="mt-10">What is Crypto Staking?</h2>

      <p>
        Like we mentioned above, crypto staking is the process of offering your crypto assets to help verify
        transactions. When you stake crypto, you are essentially putting your crypto up as
        collateral to help validate these transactions.<br />
        As a token of appreciation for your support, you earn rewards in the form of new crypto tokens. The amount of
        crypto you earn and the payout interval will depend on the crypto asset
        you stake, the length of time you stake it for, and the network's overall health.<br />
        Not all cryptocurrencies can be staked though.
        Only cryptocurrencies that use a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm can be staked. Proof-of-Stake is a consensus
        mechanism that requires participants to stake coins in order for them to
        be randomly selected as a validator of the network. Because participants have to give up their crypto assets,
        the network is thought to be less susceptible to hacks. After all, participants
        would not want to tamper with the blockchain, lose their crypto assets and the potential for rewards for the
        sake of hacking it.<br />
        PoS is one of different ways blockchains can process and verify transactions. Another method is called
        Proof-of-Work, which we will explain later. For now, keep in mind that PoS keeps
        the blockchain distributed, decentralized and secure.<br />
        Crypto staking can be a great way to earn passive income from your crypto holdings while helping to secure a
        blockchain network, which can be a noble contribution.<br />

      <h2 class="mt-10">How Does Crypto Staking Work?</h2>

      <p>
        To stake crypto, you need to have a crypto wallet that supports staking. Not all crypto wallets or
        cryptocurrencies support staking, so be sure to check that your wallet allows you to
        stake.<br />
        Once you have a compatible wallet, you will need to deposit the cryptocurrency you wish to stake into your
        wallet. If you bought crypto from the Netcoins platform, then you'd need to
        withdraw your crypto from Netcoins and deposit them into your wallet.<br />
        Once your crypto is in your wallet and ready to be staked, the actual process of staking will vary depending on
        the crypto asset you are staking and the platform you are using and the
        directions provided to you. When your crypto is in your staking account it will start earning rewards.<br />
        You can choose to stake your crypto for a specific length of time. For example, you may wish to stake your
        crypto for one year to receive the maximum amount of rewards. Or, you may
        decide to unstake your crypto at any time (depending on the platform and blockchain) but doing so will likely
        forfeit any rewards that you have earned up until that point. <br />
        It s important to note that crypto staking is not the same as mining. With mining, you use your computer s
        processing power to help validate transactions on a blockchain rather than
        offer up existing coins. On the other hand, with staking, you are simply holding crypto in your wallet as
        collateral. You are not using your computer's processing power or solving
        complex mathematical problems (like in mining).<br />
        Generally speaking, when you stake crypto, your crypto assets are used to help validate transactions on a
        blockchain network.<br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-10">The Rewards You Get for Staking Crypto</h2>

      <p>
        The amount of crypto you earn from staking will mostly depend on the crypto asset you stake and the length of
        time you stake it for.<br />
        As an example, if you stake Cardano for 12 months, you may earn around 3% to 6% per year. But if you stake it
        for two months, you might make just 1% to 2%. If you stake a less well-
        known crypto asset like PIVX, you could earn over 6% per year. But you could expose yourself to more volatility
        and risk. That's why it's important to do your due diligence on ease of
        staking, reward pay-out, and risks involved.<br />
        It's also important to remember that crypto prices and rewards are volatile and can go up or down at any time. A
        safer bet can be staking stablecoins tied to a fiat currency (like the U.S dollar). With stablecoins, you can earn staking rewards without the worrying too much about volatility.<br />
        Often times, staking cryptocurrencies can also grant you voting rights over proposals, changes and the future
        direction of that crypto.<br />
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-10">The Risks of Crypto Staking</h2>

      <p>
        Staking cryptocurrencies provides passive income to crypto stakers, but it also has some potential
        downsides.<br />
        When you stake crypto, you are essentially locking up your crypto asset for a period of time. This means that
        you cannot sell or trade your crypto while it's being staked. If the price of
        crypto goes up while your crypto is staked, you could miss out on those gains. Inversely, if the crypto assets
        you have staked lose value, you could lose money.<br />
        Finally, if the blockchain network you are staking for experiences a hack or an attack, your crypto could be at
        risk too[3].<br />
